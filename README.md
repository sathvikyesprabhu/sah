## Predicting GOS scores for patients suffering from subarachnoid hemorrhage

Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when the blood leaks into the subarachnoid space in the brain. The outcome can be predicted in terms of the GOS (Glasgow Outcome Scale) score which ranges from 1-5.

GOS Scale
1. Death-	Severe injury or death without recovery of consciousness
2. Persistent vegetative state- 	Severe damage with prolonged state of unresponsiveness and a lack of higher mental functions
3. Severe disability- 	Severe injury with permanent need for help with daily living
4. Moderate disability- 	No need for assistance in everyday life, employment is possible but may require special equipment.
5. Low disability-	Light damage with minor neurological and psychological deficits.
